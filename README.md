# Notes-App

A simple note taking app I created to practice using the Room library.

## Technologies

The app is written entirely in Kotlin targeting Android 12 API level 32 and uses the following technologies:

- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) data persistance library using SQLite

- [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)

- [List Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/ListAdapter)

- [Live Data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)

- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) to query the database away from the main thread.

- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) to observe changes in the database.
